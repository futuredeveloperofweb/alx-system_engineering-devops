1- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue?
  Terminating SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) at the load balancer level refers to the practice of decrypting encrypted SSL/TLS traffic at the load balancer before it is forwarded to the backend servers.

2- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue?
  Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Vulnerability to Outages: If the single write-enabled server experiences hardware failure, software issues, or network problems, all write operations to the database will be halted
  Scalability Limitations:
Performance Bottleneck: A single server can only handle a limited amount of write traffic. As your application's workload grows, the server may become overloaded
  Maintenance Challenges:
Downtime for Updates and Maintenance: Performing routine maintenance tasks, such as applying security patches or upgrading the MySQL server
  Disaster Recovery Challenges:
Data Loss Risk: If the single server experiences a catastrophic failure, there's a risk of losing all data since there's no other server actively replicating the data
